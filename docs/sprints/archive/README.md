# Archived Sprint Plans

This folder contains sprint planning documents that are not currently relevant but may be useful for reference later.

## Team-Based Plans (Archive)

These plans were created assuming a 5-6 person development team. They are archived here for future reference when you hire a team post-fundraising.

### When to Use These:
- After raising seed funding ($500K+)
- After hiring a development team (2 frontend, 1 backend, 1 devops, 1 PM)
- When building production-ready platform (not demo)

### Current Plan (Solo Developer):
Use `/docs/sprints/SPRINT_05_SOLO.md` instead - designed for solo development with AI tools.
