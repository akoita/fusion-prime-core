# Fusion Prime: Investment Opportunity

**One-Pager** | Confidential | November 2025

## 🎯 Elevator Pitch

**Fusion Prime is multi-chain treasury management for DeFi protocols and DAOs.** We aggregate assets across Ethereum, Polygon, and other chains into a single dashboard with real-time risk monitoring, cross-chain settlements, and built-in fiat on/off-ramps.

Think **"Plaid for Web3"** - one API, all chains, self-custody.

---

## 💡 The Problem

**DeFi treasurers manage $10M+ across 5+ chains using 10 different tools. It's manual, error-prone, and risky.**

- 📊 No unified view → Can't see total exposure
- ⚠️ No real-time risk monitoring → Liquidations happen unexpectedly
- ⏰ Manual cross-chain transfers → 30+ minutes per transfer
- 💸 Fiat conversions require 3rd party → Security + compliance risk
- ⏱️ **20 hours/week wasted** on treasury management

---

## ✅ The Solution

**One dashboard for everything:**

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Multi-Chain Portfolio** | View $50M across 5 chains in real-time |
| **Unified Credit Line** | Use all collateral, borrow against any chain |
| **Cross-Chain Settlements** | Transfer assets in 3 minutes (vs. 30+) |
| **Real-Time Risk** | Margin health alerts, prevent liquidations |
| **Fiat Integration** | On/off-ramp without leaving platform |
| **Self-Custody** | You control your keys |
