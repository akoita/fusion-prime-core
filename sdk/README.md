## SDKs

Client libraries for institutional partners integrating with Fusion Prime APIs and smart contracts.

- `python/`: Python package (async-first) for treasury automation, settlement flows.
- `ts/`: TypeScript-first SDK for web and Node integrations (with ESM/CJS builds if required).

Each SDK should expose typed clients, signing helpers, webhook handlers, and example playbooks. Align releases with API versioning strategy in `api/`.
